# Heart-disease-ml-project

## Discription
This project is dedicated to the development of a predictive model leveraging machine learning algorithms to determine the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. Additionally, the project encompasses a comprehensive data analysis phase to inform the construction and refinement of the machine learning model.

### About

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

### Code

Template code is provided in the `hear-disease-project.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the the `heart-disease.csv` dataset file to complete your work.
